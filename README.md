# WotDataLib

This library enables you to read tank data from the World of Tanks game client. It was developed for use with [Tank Icon Maker](https://bitbucket.org/rstarkov/tankiconmaker/), but can conceivably be used in other projects.

A minimal usage example can be found in the [TankDataConverter](https://bitbucket.org/rstarkov/tankdataconverter/) project.
